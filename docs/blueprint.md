- Use a clean and modern layout with clear sections for Services, Certifications, Projects, and Contact. Prioritize ease of navigation.
- Incorporate industry-relevant icons that subtly reinforce the nature of the services, such as symbols for testing, engineering, and inspection.
- Vibrant accent for calls to action and key elements, balanced by neutral tones for backgrounds and text, with subtle shifts in shading to distinguish sections.
- Consistently use 'Space Grotesk' for impactful headings (H1, H2, H3) in medium to bold weights, and 'Inter' for all body text, ensuring ample line height for readability.
- Integrate industry-relevant icons that subtly reinforce services like testing (flask, magnifying glass), engineering (gear, blueprint), and inspection (eye, clipboard), maintaining a consistent style and using them to enhance section content without cluttering the design.
- Structure sections like Services in a card-based grid, Certifications as a clear list, and Projects with high-quality visuals, ensuring a sticky header, clear navigation links, and logical flow for optimal user experience.
